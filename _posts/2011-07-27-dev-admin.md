title: "dev-admin: Punching holes in your security since summer 2011"
---
At work we had a situation where we needed developers to be able to run
a preset number of jobs, to maintain the development-instances we have of some
products. We didn't want to give them shell access, so instead I wrote a small
[node.js-based](http://nodejs.org) web-server that they can access, select
a job, and run it. The source code is at
[github](https://github.com/omega/dev-admin) if you want to peek.

## The cool bits

The cool bits in this is the use of [socket.io](http://socket.io), or at least
that is the cool bit for me, since I have been wanting to play with web sockets
or something like it for a while.

What I loved about socket.io was how easy it made it. For me it sort of removed
the seperation between client and server. Fire events on the server, listen for
them on the client. I use the custom event stuff, not only send packages,
because, lets face it, why not when it's there? :)

The main part of the website is a console-window, where the output of any
running process shows up, live, to all users on the web-page. Each instance of
dev-admin is only allowed to run one script at a time, so it also locks the
form-controls, stopping people from running more jobs while one is running.

### Running scripts

We wanted the system to be flexible, so what I ended up with was something that
could handle groups of scripts, and even let you present forms via the web
frontend to configure those scripts. Our concrete need was drupal, so the
scripts that is in the repo now as examples are all based around drupal and
drush.

In nodejs I spawn a bash process and talk to it via `STDIN` (no kiddin', I do
\:p). The first hurdle was that the output didn't look very good. All input
would be sent at once, and then all the output would appear as it was running.
Not very satisfactory for debugging jobs, I can tell you that much.

The decission was that ordering was more important than complex scripts, so we
went with one line, one statement. What we do then is we output another command
(hidden from the user interface) that will send a special sequence on `STDOUT`
once the command is finished. We then look for this sequence before issuing the
next command and so on.

So the order is great now, what about drush and it's *ANSI* output? Well, the
solution was to write a really simple *ANSI* parser in javascript, that re-writes
any *ANSI* formating sequences to `<span>` with classes.

The result? pretty output, yay!

Once the process is done, the border changes color, depending on success or
failure (If one of the commands in the script fail, we also exit imideatly).
Here is an example of success!
