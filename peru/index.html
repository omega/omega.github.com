            <p>Landed in Lima, Peru, after 33 hours or so on the road. I crashed the immigration computer system (or there was just a coincidence in timings :)</p>

<p>Taxi ride trough Lima with a driver that only spoke spanish, but he was a nice guy, teaching me some spanish words on the road. After a shower and some catchup with Martin, we headed out in Miraflores for some dinner. Had Guinea pig, two “feet”. Tasted salty, but good :) There was some sort of big group on the restaurant, and they played guitar and sang loudly.</p>

            <p>Breakfast at the same place :) Afterwards I walked quite far to join Martin me his coworkers for lunch, which they have at the same place every day it seems. I visited the office after lunch, and on the way out of the office I got &quot;exchange scammed&quot; and ended up with a fake 100 soles bill :(</p>

<p>My sunburn got even worse, forcing me to pick up a hat on the way home. People laughed at me on the way home, but oh well :)</p>

<p>In the afternoon we had a sandwich, and got me a SIM card. Martin then cooked dinner at home on a relaxing night :)</p>

            <p>Another day in Lima. Was badly sunburned, so took it easy indoors. Even forgot to get lunch!</p>

<p>In the evening I had dinner with Martin and his colleague Bjørnar at Amaz, which was great jungle inspired food.</p>

<p>Afterwards Martin and I lost some money at a blackjack table :)</p>
